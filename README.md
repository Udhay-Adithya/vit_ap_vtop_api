## Overview
The VIT-AP VTOP API is designed to help students access their academic information programmatically. It is built using Python and is hosted on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). The API scrapes data from the [V-TOP](https://vtop.vitap.ac.in/vtop/) Portal using the userâ€™s credentials.

## Features
- **Attendance**: Fetch attendance details for the user.
- **Biometric Log**: Retrieve biometric logs for the user.
- **Exam Schedule**: Get the exam schedule for the user.
- **HOD Details**: Access Head of Department details.
- **Mentor Details**: Access mentor details.
- **Time Table**: Get the user's class timetable.
- **User Profile Info**: Retrieve the user's profile information.

## Future Updates
We are committed to improving this API and the companion app. Future updates will include new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

## Companion App
I have also developed a companion app for this API. The VITAP Student App provides a user-friendly interface for accessing your academic information on your mobile device. You can find the app repository [here](https://github.com/Udhay-Adithya/vit_ap_student_app/).

We encourage users to try out the app and provide feedback. Future updates will enhance both the API and the app to better serve the needs of VIT-AP students.
